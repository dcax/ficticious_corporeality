This is for a later project where the physics of rigid bodies is described.

Rigid bodies have total mass M and center of mass r_c (in inversal reference frame). 

For a rigid body with center of mass r_c (all vectors),
r_i = position of ith particle in origin reference frame = r_c + r_hat*R.
R is distance from r_c to r_i and r_hat is along that displacement.
Diffrentiating,using rigidity (distance between points is constant),
v_i = v_c + omega*theta*R. 
Same angular velocity and angular accelaration for each particle by rigidity. 
-> a_i = a_c + alpha * theta * R - omega^2 * r_hat * R.
m_i*a_i = F_i.
(r_hat*R) x F_i = Torque on particle i = T_i.
m_i*R^2*k_hat*alpha = T_i.
Summing, T = total torque,
T = S(m_i*R_i^2)*alpha_hat.
