# ficticious_corporeality
This is a general purpose physics simulator with a focus on discrete waves. 

Tests should focus on the application to sheets and snell's law with premade objects. 

TODO:
- Implement more general constraint system. 
- Better system couplings. 
- Systems without conserved particles.
- Massless systems (E and B).
